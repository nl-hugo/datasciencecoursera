#Run Analysis

Course project for the [Getting and Cleaning Data course](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-013)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##run_analysis.R

This script collects and processes the raw data and then saves a tidy data set: 
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
